BestVoice is a mobile web app designed to provide Best Buy customers with a personalized and optimized in-store experience. Our team targeted a major demographic within Vancouver by trying to alleviate the language barrier that immigrants experience. Through BestVoice, non-English speakers can use a smart phone to ask questions and have a conversation with Best Buy employees in their own languages.
